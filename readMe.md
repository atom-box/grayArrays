# Bracket Cat
Swiss tournament bracket maker; SQL skill demonstrator.

## Goal
Make an independent project to integrate into one coherent, 
self-designed project a full 
stack app, based on the numerous tutorials I completed in 2018.

## Technologies
* JS and Vue on the front end
* Node and Express.js on the back end
* DB will be whichever SQL is most mainstream on my Digital Ocean server
